# `MD054` - Link and image style

Tags: `images`, `links`

Aliases: `link-image-style`

Parameters:

- `autolink`: Allow autolinks (`boolean`, default `true`)
- `inline`: Allow inline links and images (`boolean`, default `true`)
- `reference`: Allow reference links and images (`boolean`, default `true`)

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

Links and images in Markdown can provide the link destination or image source at
the time of use or can use a label to reference a definition elsewhere in the
document. The reference format is convenient for keeping paragraph text
clutter-free and makes it easy to reuse the same URL in multiple places.

By default, this rule allows all link/image styles. It is possible to disable
one or more of those styles.

Setting the `autolink` parameter to `false` disables autolinks:

```markdown
<https://example.com>
```

Setting the `inline` parameter to `false` disables inline links and images:

```markdown
[link](https://example.com)

![image](https://example.com)
```

Setting the `reference` parameter to `false` disables full, collapsed, and
shortcut reference links and images:

```markdown
[link][url]

[url][]

[url]

![image][url]

![url][]

![url]

[url]: https://example.com
```

To fix violations of this rule, change the link or image to use an allowed
style. This rule can automatically fix violations when a link or image can be
converted to the `inline` style (preferred) or a link can be converted to the
`autolink` style (which does not support images and must be an absolute URL).
This rule does not fix scenarios that require converting a link or image to the
`reference` style because that involves naming the reference and knowing where
in the document to insert it.

Rationale: Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.
Autolinks are concise, but appear as URLs which can be long and confusing.
Inline links and images can include descriptive text, but take up more space in
Markdown form. Reference links and images can be easier to read and manipulate
in Markdown form, but require editing two locations.
